sprint-stats
============

Small command line tool to calculate stats for sprint planning

Currently a work in progress, no warranty provided, I am not responsible if it eats your dog.

On a related note, if your a project manager and you want to use this tool for calculating a feature roadmap, DON'T DO IT! 
You don't undstand agile if you're trying to plan more than a sprint or two ahead of time.
